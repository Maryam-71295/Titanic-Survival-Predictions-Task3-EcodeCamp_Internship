# Titanic-Survival-Predictions-Task3-EcodeCamp_Internship
This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts Titanic passenger survival using a trained decision tree model with 80% accuracy. Users can input passenger details like class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation point, and the app will predict whether the passenger survived or not based on the input data.
